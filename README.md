# WEATHER REQUESTER

This simple project gets weather from the requested city. It can only get temperature right now but more information about the weather will be implemented.

## HOW TO RUN
To make it possible to run you need to get an API key from https://openweathermap.org/ .
This is free and it's easy to recieve the key. After you have recieved the key:
1. Create a file named ".env" in the same directory as weather.py
2. Insert the api key in this file it should look something like this:
'''
API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
'''
3. The app should now run by running the python script and adding the city from where the weather is requested.

### Example
'''
python weather.py Stockholm
'''
